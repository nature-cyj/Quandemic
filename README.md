## Abstract

## The Quandemic

### Objectives
- PCR test each citizen and obtain negative result for everyone.

### Contents

- Citizens<br>
A quantum circuit with 9 qubits represents a city that 9 citizens live with a deadly virus.
0's and 1's appearing on the computational basis of this system corresponds to healthy and infected
states, respectively.
Since the people live in a quantum world, the city stays in a superposition of possible infection
states!

- PCR test<br>
A PCR test corresponds to measurement on a specific qubit, or a citizen of this city. Not only
obtains a decisive result about the citizen's infection status, the test destroys possibility of the
city to be in states which counter the test result. In quantum-like words, the measurement projects
previous state into a subspace contains the measured result.

- PCR test (a total survey)<br>
For sake of the player, one can measure states of all qubits at once for only one time during the
game. It will remove superposition of the city's state, but the state will quickly branch and
involve possibilities as time goes on.

- The rotational hospital<br>
There are two hospitals in this city. First is the rotational hospital.

- The Pauli's X hospital
- Interaction between two citizens
